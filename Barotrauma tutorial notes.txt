Barotrauma tutorial notes
- Teaches each role's tasks in a clear and simple way and sort of sets up a bit of interpersonal drama? (Stereotypes about each role.)
- Players' roles are to manage buffers before they get too full or too empty.
* There are options for buffers to manage themselves
* There are options for more manual control for better control in many cases
* There are options for players to 'enable' additional buffers to manage for higher speeds, e.g. overheating a supercapacitor allows it to fill with power faster but it also builds up heat which you don't want to reach 100% or else

- Many possibilities for players to make mistakes! These are intentionally set up to cause (fun?) problems of bad buffer management.
- Many problems occur as a result of other players' mistakes or mismanagement of buffers
- Fixing each other's problems. Is this fun?
