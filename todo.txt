todo (June 17)
- planets
x multiplayer?
x return throttle to original
	x double tap to maintain throttle?
- strafe
x new model
- death on collision

[2m] git
[2m] normal throttle
[13m] double tap hold throttle
[16m] x unsolved vertical ship model blrgh
[???hrs] ship model works, multiplayer works :)

other magic stuff
- documentation should link to the Book when possible?
	e.g. docs for parent/child/local_to_parent/local_to_world in the api should link to https://ambientrun.github.io/Ambient/reference/hierarchies.html
- learn: how to edit documentation?
- ECS visualization is obvious; concepts are groups of components, also obvious useful things
	- queries are ALSO obvious, which is very cool! just a drag n drop function call with parameters
