starting today i forget what yesterday's intentions were. may not get a lot done.
ok, i'd like to use actual assets for my objects and not feel constrained to cubes.
	[x] simple 3d models - took four or so hours to learn how to make models (not good ones) + make them work.
	[ ] simple 2d sprites (billboarded)
